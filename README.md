# Lab #1 â€“ HTTP Web Server

```
Test Machine: CSEL-KH1250-12
```
## Usage

To run my Web Server first ensure you are in the root directory of the project (/webServer) and then run

```
make
```

to build the object files and link everything together. The server can then be started using ./server
followed by the path to the config file. This command is also included in the makefile which can be 
accessed using

```
make run
```

## CGI Usage

Using the included form.htm and form2.htm I directly integrated the forms into the SHOP page at the bottom
of the scrollable pane. A picture below is included for reference in locating the links

## Algorithms

My HTTP 1.0 Web Server is complete with request/response HTML and graphics functionality, concurrency in
the form of threading, CGI Get and Post responsing, logging, and a basic config file for quickly changing
server parameters. In my testing using firefox everything functioned correctly with no issues.
